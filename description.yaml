  description: |
    This project is a calculation programm to numericaly investigate 
    qunatum solitons present in onedimensional array of singlemode  
    waveguides with cubic nonlinearity. The evolution of quantum properties  
    of light is described via a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations
    obtaind in Gaussion approximation for quantum state of light.
parameters:
  - name: Nfibs
    description: number of waveguides in the array
  - name: Nfibs_calc
    description: size of waveguides subarray near the central one, for which will be calculated logarithmic negativity (for each pair in subarray)
  - name: L
    description: nonlinearity coefficient
  - name: gamma
    description: parameter which defines classic soliton profile used as initial state
properties:
  - name: cl_device_type # this property should take two values GPU or CPU
    optional: true # a boolean property which shows if this property is required for calculation. Default: false 
    list: false #flag to show that if need to set a list of properties here. Default: false
    type: string #shows the type of the property: currently we support only int, string, float, boolean  
  - name: cl_device_number
    optional: true # a boolean property which shows if this property is required for calculation. Default: false 
    list: false #flag to show that if need to set a list of properties here. Default: false
    type: int #shows the type of the property: currently we support only int, string, float, boolean  
outputs:
  - name: I
    description: the stationary solution, first Nfibs values - alpha_n, next Nfibs * Nfibs - <a^{\dag}_n a_m>, last Nfibs * Nfibs - <a_n a_m>
